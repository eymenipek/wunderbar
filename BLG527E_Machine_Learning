Lecture 1.1

- Types of learners
- Data samples and features
- Training and testing set
- Cross-validation


George Leonard - Mastery

3 types of learners
- Dabblers: Over excited about learners, give up at plateau
- Hackers: Keep using same techniques, stucked in plateau, after plateau they stop
- Masters: Constantly aimind to improve themselves, try different things

Lecture 1.2
Training and Testing Sets

Each picture: data sample and data point --> image of a cat
- Voice signal
- Text
- Image

Classification of cats and dogs
- Dataset 1: Cats
- Dataset 2: Dogs

- What makes the difference: ears, nose (features)
Extract features to distinguish cats and dogs

Cat vector:

- Shape of ear
- Size of nose
