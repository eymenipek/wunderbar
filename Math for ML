Linear Algebra
  - Performs operations in the data
  Scalar: Skaler buyuklukler
  Vectors: Vektorler - List of numbers for CS that represents something (Sutun ya da satir -> 1xN ya da Nx1)
  
  Vector Addition - Dot Product
  Scalar Multiplication - Either grows or shrinks
  Projection - Shadow of a vector
  
  
 Matrices - Composition of numbers
 
 2x + 2y = 10
 4x + y = 18
  
 | 2  2 | | x | = | 10 |
 | 4  1 | | y |   | 18 |
  
Matrix Multiplication
  - Multiplying the rows of Matrix 1 with the columns of Matrix 2
  - The rows of Matrix 1 need to be equal to column of Matrix 2 for it to work
