Linear Algebra
  - Performs operations in the data
  Scalar: Skaler buyuklukler
  Vectors: Vektorler - List of numbers for CS that represents something (Sutun ya da satir -> 1xN ya da Nx1)
  
  Vector Addition - Dot Product
  Scalar Multiplication - Either grows or shrinks
  Projection - Shadow of a vector
  
  
 Matrices - Composition of numbers
 
 2x + 2y = 10
 4x + y = 18
  
 | 2  2 | | x | = | 10 |
 | 4  1 | | y |   | 18 |
  
Matrix Multiplication
 - Multiplying the rows of Matrix 1 with the columns of Matrix 2
 - The rows of Matrix 1 need to be equal to column of Matrix 2 for it to work

Transpose
 - Interchanging rows and columns of a Matrix
 
Determinant
 - Scalar value of the Matrix
 - Product of Eigen values of Matrix
 
      | a b c |
 A =  | d e f |
      | g h i |
      
Det(A) = aei+bfg+cdh - afh - bdi - ceg

Inverse of Matrix
 - A matrix gives the Identity Matrix when multiplied by Inverse
 - Inverse helps us apply transformations easily
 - Some matrices don't have inverse --> This means the information is not reliable and very noisy
 
Linear Algebra - Vector as a Matrix
 - Vectors can be easily translated to Matrix
 - They make it easily to apply operations on the data
 - Certain well-known operations are:
